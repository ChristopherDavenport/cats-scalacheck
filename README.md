# cats-scalacheck [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ChristopherDavenport/cats-scalacheck.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ChristopherDavenport/cats-scalacheck) [![Maven Central](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/io.chrisdavenport/cats-scalacheck_2.12/badge.svg)](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/io.chrisdavenport/cats-scalacheck_2.12)

Inspiration Was Taken From the never published cats-check. So all credit to [erik-stripe](https://github.com/erik-stripe) and the last maintainer [mdedetrich](https://github.com/mdedetrich) for their original work on this that helped me build this.

## Quick Start

To use cats-scalacheck in an existing SBT project with Scala 2.11 or a later version, add the following dependency to your
`build.sbt`:

```scala
libraryDependencies += "io.chrisdavenport" %% "cats-scalacheck" % "<version>"
```
